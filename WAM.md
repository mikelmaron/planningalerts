We currently have scrapers for Camden and Tower Hamlets in PHP, and scrapers for all the others except Westminster in python. The Westminster site is a bit different, and may require some work.

Done:

  * Barking and Dagenham
  * Braintree
  * Camden (also has PlanningExplorer - we have scrapers for both)
  * Castle Point
  * Chichester (also has PublicAccess)
  * Colchester
  * East Lothian
  * North Somerset
  * Nottingham
  * Poole
  * Rother
  * South Gloucestershire
  * South Norfolk (appears to have PlanningExplorer as well) (No postcodes)
  * Tower Hamlets (done)
