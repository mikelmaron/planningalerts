The following authorities have a similar application search mechanism. The urls all end in searchparam.asp.

  * East Northamptonshire (also has a PublicAccess, which seems to contain more applications)
  * Harborough (also has a PublicAccess, which seems a slightly different set of applications...)
  * Melton
  * Rutland

I've made a scraper for these, which is currently called RutlandLike (as I can't see a more sensible name for it). It is only actually in use for Melton and Rutland, as East Northants and Harborough also have PublicAccess sites, which appear to be more recent.
