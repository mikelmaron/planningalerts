Proposed development of a scraper for the Plan-It system.

= Authorities =

 * Hounslow: [http://planning.hounslow.gov.uk/planningv2/planning_search.aspx]
 * Kingston: [http://maps.kingston.gov.uk/isis_main/planning/planning_search.aspx]
 * Richmond (London): [http://www2.richmond.gov.uk/PlanData2/Planning_Search.aspx] 
 * Wiltshire: [http://www.wiltshireplanningapplications.co.uk/planning_search.aspx]

= Notes =

 * There is a limit in the search form to the number of queries but this is not validated in software (tested with Richmond). It is therefore possible to search for a larger number of applications than the maximum of 500.
