#summary A list of planning authorities.

= List of Planning Authorities =

I'm planning on having a list here of all the planning authorities in the UK, and the urls of any application search facility they have (along with a note maybe of what sort of site it is if I recognise it...)

The list of authorities I am getting them from is here http://www.theplanningdirectory.co.uk/auto/index.html.
