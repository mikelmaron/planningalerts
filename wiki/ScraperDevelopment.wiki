  * Canterbury (Duncan) - AcolNet. results table is different from usual format
  * Guildford (Duncan) - AcolNet, but odd.
  * Isle of Man (Dan)
  * Surrey Heath (Duncan) - AcolNet - The problem here looks like it might be cookie and javascript related.
  * Wychavon (Duncan) - an AcolNet site, but slightly odd.
