  * Cambridgeshire (Duncan) - AcolNet. no advanced search page - will need some work
  * Isle of Man (Dan)
  * Kensington and Chelsea (Duncan) - AcolNet (maybe!)
  * Mid Bedfordshire (Duncan) - AcolNet (but requires username and password)
  * Surrey Heath (Duncan) - AcolNet - The problem here looks like it might be cookie and javascript related.
