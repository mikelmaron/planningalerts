If such a policy did not exist this site would be a fantastic source of information, they seem like a very switched on technology company. I am interested in how much legal founding their statement is, surely the information is in the public domain?

I am very aware that we do not want to get involved in any form of legal wrangling with them but if we could put together a valid argument for our right to access this information then maybe they would be keen to work with us?

Does anyone know if there is a legal difference between the source of data and the copyright of data? Surely it doesn't matter who publishes something - if the information is in the public domain then anyone can copy it?

Of course there is also the question of etiquette and it would be rude to screen scrape their site when they clearly do not want people to. Basically I'm thinking out loud here.
