We now have a scraper for most of these in python.
We also have scrapers for a couple (Camden and Hackney) in PHP.

Done, and working:
  * Blackburn
  * Camden - done (has OSGB)
  * Charnwood (done, site has a problem with its info links)
  * Conwy
  * Crewe and Nantwich
  * East Staffordshire
  * Epping Forest
  * Hackney
  * Kennet
  * Lincoln (also WAM)
  * Liverpool
  * Merton
  * Shrewsbury
  * Swansea
  * South Shropshire
  * South Tyneside
  * Stockport
  * Tamworth
  * Trafford
  * Waltham Forest

A few have no postcodes. In some cases they provide OSGB, which we should probably use instead.

  * Broadland (no postcodes)
  * Forest Heath (no postcodes)
  * South Norfolk (appears to have WAM as well) (No postcodes - but has OSGB coords)
  * West Oxfordshire (no postcodes)
