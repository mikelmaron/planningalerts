There is now a scraper written in python for FastWeb sites. The ones that I know of so far are:

  * Craven
  * Eastleigh
  * Eden
  * Mansfield
  * South Lakeland
  * Sutton
  * Welwyn-Hatfield
  * Wyre Forest

Redcar is listed as being FastWeb here: http://www.brent.gov.uk/egr.nsf/SCV?ReadForm&View=UseByProductName&Category=FastPLANNING but this doesn't seem to be the case.
